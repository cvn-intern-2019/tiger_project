# Werewolf Online - Tiger Team

## **DESCRIBE:**

This is project of Tiger Team when we join the internship in Cybozu Vietnam company.

- **What is Werewolf?**

  - Werewolf (_traditional version_) is a simple game (a mind game) for a large group of people (seven or more.) It requires no equipment besides some bits of paper; you can play it just sitting in a circle. I'd call it a party game, except that it's a game of accusations, lying, bluffing, second-guessing, assassination, and mob hysteria. _(by [https://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html](https://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html))_
