# Werewolf Online - Tiger Team
1. **DESCRIBE:**
This is project of Tiger Team when we join the internship in Cybozu Vietnam company.
- **What is Werewolf?**
  - Werewolf (*traditional version*) is a simple game (a mind game) for a large group of people (seven or more.) It requires no equipment besides some bits of paper; you can play it just sitting in a circle. I'd call it a party game, except that it's a game of accusations, lying, bluffing, second-guessing, assassination, and mob hysteria. *(by [https://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html](https://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html))*
  - Werewolf Online is completely inherited from traditional version (with a little our configure). We hope it "will works" well and bring you joy. :D
